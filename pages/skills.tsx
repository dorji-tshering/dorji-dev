                        Itâ€™s been more than two years  since I started learning web development. 
                        Within that duration, I have equipped myself with skills and technologies. 
                        I have done multiple projects both personal and as a part of a job interview. 
                        The percentage ratings of the languages and frameworks depict my 
                        <span className='text-theme mx-[6px] font-[500]'>experience</span>and the 
                        <span className='text-theme mx-[6px] font-[500]'>confidence</span> 
                        I feel going forward to build a any web applications
                        which is solely based on the projects I have done over the years. Please don't mistake the 
                        ratings to the knowledge I have of the technology as I believe one can't possibly
                        accurately determine one's grasp of the technology given the nature and amount of details and concepts. 
                        I learn and pick new concepts as and when I am presented with new projects and challenges.
